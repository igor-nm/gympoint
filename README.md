# Gympoint - API
Gympoint is a RocketSeatâ€™s back-end project that I need to do a full api, with database communication and many routes with treat. Also using middlewares, docker, postgres, debug on vscode and other things.
It is being used as a study project to improve my hard skills. This challenge is part of the course conclusion.
